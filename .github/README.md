## Mission

Our mission is to increase a sense of belonging and reduce social anxiety amongst new High School students. 

Bubl does this by providing Middle School students who are transitioning to High School a space to have topical discussions and develop relationships with other students who have similar interests.

## Technologies

This portion of the project (the landing page and marketing site for Bubl) was build using HTML, Less/CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
